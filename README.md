IPL MATCH DATA ANALYSIS USING PYTHONIPL MATCH DATA ANALYSIS USING PYTHON
Project Overview: IPL Match Data Analysis📊🏏
🎯Objective: The primary goal of this project was to analyze IPL match data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights using Python libraries.

Operations:

•Data Collection: Gathered IPL match data from reliable sources.
•Data Cleaning: Used libraries like Pandas to clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and ensuring consistency.
•Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize key statistics and trends.
•Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance the analysis, such as player performance metrics and match conditions.
•Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards using matplotlib(pyplot) to present findings.

🎯Conclusions:
•Identified key factors influencing match outcomes, such as toss results and player form.
•Highlighted top-performing players and teams based on various metrics.
•Provided actionable insights for team strategies and player selections.
